            <h1 style="color: white;">Karma Puja  </h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Karma Puja is a significant tribal festival celebrated with great enthusiasm in Jharkhand, especially among communities like the Oraon, Munda, Ho, and other indigenous groups. Observed in the month of Bhadrapada (August-September), the festival is dedicated to the worship of the Karam tree, which symbolizes fertility, prosperity, and the deep connection between people and nature. On this day, villagers bring branches of the Karam tree from the forest and plant them in the village, where they are worshipped with rituals, songs, and traditional dances that continue throughout the night. Women, particularly unmarried girls, play a central role by fasting and praying for the well-being and prosperity of their brothers, while the entire community participates in the festivities, which also include the nurturing of seedlings and the sharing of a communal feast. Karma Puja not only marks the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the harvest but also strengthens social bonds and highlights the importance of environmental conservation in tribal culture.</p>

            <h1 style="color: white;">Sarhul  </h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Sarhul is one of the most important and vibrant festivals celebrated in Jharkhand, especially among the tribal communities such as the Munda, Oraon, and Ho. The festival marks the beginning of the new year and the arrival of spring, usually taking place in the month of Chaitra (March-April). During Sarhul, the Sal tree is worshipped as a symbol of nature and fertility. The village priest, known as the Pahan, leads rituals to honor the village deity and the spirits of ancestors, praying for a good harvest, peace, and prosperity. People offer flowers, fruits, and traditional rice beer (handia) to the deities and ancestors. The celebration is filled with traditional music, dance, and communal feasting, bringing the entire community together in joy and gratitude for nature’s blessings. Sarhul not only reflects the deep bond between the tribal people and their natural environment but also reinforces social unity and cultural identity in Jharkhand.</p>

            <h1 style="color: white;">Sohari  </h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Sohrai is a vibrant harvest and cattle festival celebrated across Jharkhand, especially among tribal communities such as the Santhal, Munda, Oraon, and Sadan. The festival takes place annually on the day after Diwali, coinciding with the new moon (Amavasya) in the Hindu month of Kartik (October–November). Sohrai is dedicated to honoring cattle, which play a crucial role in tribal households and agriculture. Preparations involve cleaning and decorating homes, painting mud walls with natural colors, and preparing special foods. Cattle are bathed, their horns and foreheads are adorned with oil and vermilion, and they are worshipped with lamps, songs, and offerings. The festivities span several days, including rituals such as Garh Puja, communal dancing, singing, and feasting. Married daughters return home to join the celebrations, and the entire community participates in expressing gratitude for livestock and nature’s bounty. Sohrai not only emphasizes the economic and cultural importance of cattle but also reinforces social bonds and showcases the rich artistic traditions of Jharkhand’s tribal societies.</p>
