            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: rgb(49, 210, 52);">Mahua is a culturally and economically important tree native to central and eastern India, including Jharkhand. Known scientifically as Madhuca longifolia, this medium-sized deciduous tree is highly valued by tribal and rural communities for its multiple uses. The tree produces sweet, nectar-rich flowers that are harvested to make a traditional alcoholic beverage called Mahua liquor, which holds a special place in tribal rituals and celebrations. Besides being used for brewing, the flowers are also dried and consumed as food. The seeds of the Mahua fruit are pressed to extract oil, which is used for cooking, lighting lamps, and in traditional medicine. Additionally, various parts of the tree are employed in Ayurvedic treatments for ailments such as skin diseases and respiratory problems. The wood serves as fuel and material for making tools. For many indigenous communities, the Mahua tree is not only a vital source of livelihood but also an integral part of their cultural heritage, symbolizing their close relationship with nature.</p>

        <div style="width: 73%; margin-left: 25%; margin-top:-330px; text-align: justify;">
            <h1 style="color: white;">Kendu  </h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color:rgb(49, 210, 52);">Kendu fruit comes from the tree Diospyros melanoxylon, which grows wild in forests across several Indian states including Jharkhand. The fruit is small, globose, about 3-4 cm in diameter, and contains 3 to 4 brown, oblong seeds. When fully ripe, the fruit has a pleasant, sweet taste and is consumed locally by tribal communities. It is rich in carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, carotene, and contains beneficial phytochemicals such as beta-carotene, flavonoids, saponins, and tannins, making it highly nutritious. Traditionally, the dried fruit powder is used as a carminative, and the fruit pulp has astringent properties used in folk medicine to treat digestive and skin ailments. The fruit pulp is also processed into various value-added products like jams, nectar, powders, and bars to extend shelf life and reduce wastage. Besides the fruit, other parts of the kendu tree, such as leaves, are economically importantâ€”leaves are widely used for making bidis (traditional hand-rolled cigarettes). Overall, kendu fruit and its tree play a vital role in the nutrition, health, and economy of tribal populations in Jharkhand and neighboring regions.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: rgb(49, 210, 52);">Dhuska is a well known deep fried snack from Jharkhand. This fried snacks are eaten all over Jharkhand which calls for rice, channa dal as two main ingredients. Actually, earlier Jharkhand cuisine is quite unknown cuisine for me. Before a year, for an event i cooked a dish from this cuisine and totally enjoyed going through their cuisine. Learned few recipes through google master and have bookmarked few from this cuisine as much i do with other unknown cuisine. And for this month's Shh Cooking Secretly, a monthly event started by me, which is now hosted by Mayuri Patel. We are cooking from Jharkhand, and i have been paired with Priya Mahesh of  Priyas Kitchen . Priya was kind enough to give me my two ingredients which is quite a staple food for a South Indian like me. Yes my two secret ingredients are Rice and channadal. </p>
