            <h1 style="color: white;">Maa Chhinnamastike Mandir  </h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color:black;">Maa Chhinnamastike Mandir, located in Rajrappa, Ramgarh district of Jharkhand, is a renowned Hindu temple dedicated to Goddess Chhinnamasta, one of the ten Mahavidyas in the tantric tradition. The temple is situated at the confluence of the Damodar and Bhairavi rivers and is considered one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, making it a powerful center of Shakti worship. The goddess is uniquely depicted as self-decapitated, holding her severed head in one hand and a scimitar in the other, with three streams of blood flowing from her neck, symbolizing self-sacrifice, spiritual awakening, and the cycle of life and death. This fierce form of the Divine Mother embodies paradoxes such as strength and compassion, death and transcendence. The temple attracts devotees from across India, especially during festivals like Navratri, and is also significant to tribal communities who perform rituals here. The site is known for its tantric rituals, ancient architecture, and the natural beauty of the surrounding waterfalls and rivers, making it both a spiritual and cultural landmark in Jharkhand.</p>

                              The Hundru Falls Ranchi is created on the course of the Subarnarekha River, where is falls from a height of 320 feet creating the highest water falls of the state.
